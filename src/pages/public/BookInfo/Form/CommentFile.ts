			"An amazing world with well written characters, and compelling themes! The first, I would say, 30% of the book was rather a grind to get through. It wasn't bad, just a bit boring. The rest is just pure expert storytelling. The unique way of not having the usual chapters but instead having different point of views where we could read and see what each character is going through is one my favourite things.",

			"The book may be a little dragged-out and hard to get into. But once you're really into the meat of it, it makes sense why people like this book series so much. The best thing about it being so long is that I don't have to worry about the dread of finishing a book series and knowing that there's no more for a while!",

			"How are they considering Game of Thrones high fantasy? It seems like the perfect example for low fantasy to me. Most of the show revolves around politics and wars, and magic isn't a normal part of everyday life.",
